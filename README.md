# Blade-Generator
Procedurally generated swords using Math!

## How?
Swords are generated using a deterministic seed, the seed determines the number of different math functions are going to be used to draw the edge of the sword
along with where the tip of the sword will be placed. The program chooses the point where the hilt will attach to the blade of the sword then uses the seed
to determine where the function will end, then repeats this process until their is a continuous line that connect the hilt to the tip. 

## To do?
This project is long from complete, right now it just generates an outline of the blade of the sword, I would like to implement a means to also color the 
sword along with creating a hilt. To achieve these goals I plan on refactoring the program as of now it is written in a way that would make it far too 
difficult and akward to impliment these features.

## Why?
Why not it was a fun project that intrigued me and I wanted to use it to generate content for my game I was wokring on at the time.
